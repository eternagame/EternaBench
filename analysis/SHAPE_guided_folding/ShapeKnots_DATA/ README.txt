The sequences and accepted structures for all of the RNAs evaluated in the ShapeKnots paper (Hajdin et al.) are included here.

File extensions are .sequence and .ct, respectively.

The full SHAPE datasets for all RNAs are in the ShapeKnots_SNRNASM.xlsx spreadsheet.

Circle Plots of all predicted secondary structure models are in the Supp_Dataset_1_ShapeKnots_RNAs.pdf file.
